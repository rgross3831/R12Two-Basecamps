GREETING AND WELCOME
 - Leader greets and asks everyone to turn off or silence cell phones
 - Pause for participants to do so
 - (Guideline Welcome statement): Welcome, and thank you for joining us at our (Name of weekday) (Location) Romans12two Basecamp! Romans12two is a fellowship community of men committed to breaking the cycle of addiction and trauma through faith-based healing and discipleship based on the Good News of Jesus Christ.

INTRODUCTIONS
 - (Guidelines for personal introduction): Participant says - "Hi, I'm ____"; all respond "Hi ____"
 - Leader asks if any newcomers present, thanks them for their courage and presence

BASECAMP ESTABLISHMENT/PURPOSE
 - Romans12two Basecamps are places to share, learn, to know and be known, to foster accountability, etc.
 - Meetings and fellowship are the heart of Romans12two

OPENING BENDICTION AND LITURGY
 - All quote Romans 12:2 together - if some do not know it, they are free to simply listen
 - ESV (you may quote in any translation): "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect."
 - Ask for everyone to take a moment to meditate and pray on this scripture, 60 second moment of silence
 - Thank all for taking moment of silence

 - State belief that we all have been conformed to the world - sin and culture shape our minds, desires, behaviors
 - Scripture tells us in 1 John 2:15-16: "Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world."
 - Conformity is what leads us into sin: selfishness, lust, brokenness - our addiction is the evidence of this

 - We have hope when we believe Jesus Christ died for our sins on the cross and rose 3 days later, conquering sin and death
 - The Holy Spirit then dwells within us and transforms us
 - Transformation is not behavior modification, but a heart and life change through the work of the Spirit and God's promises marked by joy, peace, and purity in Christ 
 - Does this sound extravagant or impossible? (Leader encourages all to reply "We think not.")
 - When we believe, it is being actively fulfilled, in God's perfect timing

P.O.P.S. CULTURE ESTABLISHMENT
 - P.O.P.S. is how Romans12two actively practices this transformational work
 (SPEAKER) FOR THE MEETING READS
 - P.: Plank – this means we begin with ourselves, and we take responsibility for our own actions - taking the plank out of our own eye before addressing the speck in our brother’s (Matthew 7:3–5).
 - O.: Obedience – this means we submit daily to God’s Word and His Spirit, walking in holiness instead of our own way (John 14:15).
 - P.: Proactive – this means we take intentional steps to guard our hearts, pursue accountability, and live in the freedom that Christ has already purchased on our behalf (Galatians 5:1).
 - S.: Sword - This means we take up the Sword of the Spirit - which is the Word of God - by reading, studying, meditating on, and memorizing scripture… this enables us to renew our minds and allows us to take an offensive position against the enemy and his lies! (Ephesians 6:17).

CHECK-IN GUIDELINES
 - As we move into the “Check-in” portion of the night, we ask that all participants use these P.O.P.S. principles to guide the content of their check-in. And we also ask that you adhere to the 5 Meeting Guidelines, which are…
  1. Adults Only: All participants must be 18 years or older. – Is there anyone here under the age of 18? (Leader dismisses any participants under the age of 18)
  2. Plank 1st: We use the words ‘I’ or ‘we’ instead of ‘you’ when sharing about our recovery, and we address our sharing to the whole group, not to one or more individuals.
  3. Be Honest with Discernment: We expect all participants to be honest AND factual in their check-ins, but we ask that you avoid mentioning specific names or places associated with our acting out behavior… also, please avoid graphic or explicit details of sexual behavior that might trigger others that are here, or details that might present others with new avenues or ideas for pursuing sexual behavior. (Provide an example of what a healthy disclosure looks like). (If a participant goes too far with details, I will tell you to stop… this needs to be added.)
  4. No Cross-talk: There is to be no cross-talk (no interrupting, commenting, or side conversations) and no advice-giving unless asked. This is not a place to fix one another—it is a place to share, listen, and to be known… However, as a participant, we DO invite you to thank those who share, and continue to encourage one another outside these walls.
  5. Confidentiality: Everything shared here stays here. Confidentiality is essential to creating a safe and trustworthy environment. However, there are a few situations where we are legally and morally required to report what is shared. This includes(but not limited to):
    - Any information involving the abuse, neglect, or endangerment of a minor
    - Any threats of serious harm to yourself or others
    - Any disclosure of ongoing criminal activity that legally must be reported
    - Or situations where someone is in immediate danger
   -Outside of these exceptions, what you share stays in this room.

 - If we all agree to these guidelines – let us say “Amen.” (All respond "Amen")
 - Establish amount of time for check-ins (60 min / # of participants including leaders - if 8+ present, split into 2 groups with leaders in each)
  - An alarm will ring at time for each participant - respectfully ask that you wrap it up at that time
 - Check-in is brief snapshot of our previous week - GBUB Good Bad Ugly Beautiful
 - When each participant begins, please state your name
 - (SPEAKER) Keeps time for each individual check-in according to allotted time

CHECK-IN TIME

FINISH CHECK-INS

TEACHING/VISION CAST TIME

CLOSING STATEMENTS
 - We want everyone to have community
  - Community helps us learn to take responsibility for our actions, be supported, recognize our thought patterns, and restore our minds and beliefs
 - Encourage getting at least 1 person's number and checking in with them this week (establish that check-in is ideally a call not text, even better to meet 1:1)
  - This is the primary way to start to know and be known, be vulnerable and open about temptation, struggle, sin, victory; to pray and celebrate together
  - Encourage these times to also be a sobriety check-in. Sobriety defined as abstaining from:
   - Consuming pornography
   - Masturbation
   - Any sexual behavior with people who are not our wives
 - Encourage going to romans12two.org to see what other fellowship opportunities available (can speak shortly on 1 or 2 like HOOPS, 3rd Friday, etc.)

-Check in with the men in this phone book throughout the week, and meet in person for 1:1’s. However, know that these phone check-ins and 1:1’s aren’t about using others to simply offload your junk — it’s also about serving one another by listening attentively, asking thoughtful questions, and showing up for each other.
By adding your name and number to the phone book, you’re not just giving leaders permission to call you — you’re making a commitment. You’re saying, ‘I commit to reaching out to other men, and I’m willing to receive support, encouragement, and accountability from them as well.’ This mutual investment is part of what makes this community so strong.

-We strongly encourage Basecamp participants to actively get plugged into the Romans12two community - attending Romans12two fellowship events when you can, and leveraging Romans12two tools. It’s in these spaces where you’ll learn how to…
  -Live your life in the light — which means learning to be radically open about temptation, struggle, sin, or even victories — so that others can walk with you, pray with you, and celebrate with you.
  -It’s where you’ll learn how trauma has informed your addiction
  -It’s where you’ll have breakthrough moments - and where God and others will help you identify destructive beliefs and thought-patterns
  -And finally, it’s where God will begin to restore your mind - replacing sin and brokenness with joy and freedom in Him.
  
IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SPEAKER
 - Ask for a volunteer to be the Speaker of the next meeting, who will read P.O.P.S Culture, Serenity Prayer, Benediction and keep time for check-ins

MOVE TO CONCLUDE
 - Establish that the Speaker will close us with Serenity Prayer and Benediction
 - Ask everyone to stand for these

SERENITY PRAYER
 (SPEAKER)
God, grant us the serenity
to accept the things we cannot change; 
courage to change the things we can; 
and wisdom to know the difference.
Living one day at a time; 
enjoying one moment at a time; 
accepting hardships as the pathway to peace; 
taking, as Jesus did, this sinful world
as it is, not as we would have it; 
trusting that He will make all things right
if we surrender to His Will; 
So that we may be reasonably happy in this life
and supremely happy with Him forever in the next. 
Amen.

ROMANS12two BENEDICTION
 (SPEAKER)
May the Lord bless you and keep you, 
May He cause His Face to shine upon you and bring you Peace.  
May we share the Good News of Christ from a PLANK perspective, 
May we take every thought captive to make IT OBEDIENT to Christ,
May we live PROACTIVELY for our Savior, pointing our SWORDS at our True Enemy, 
All while being transformed from one degree of glory to another, into the Image of Christ Jesus… 

And all God’s people said..

 - All participants - “AMEN”
